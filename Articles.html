                    Krishi Vigyan Kendra (K.V.K.) at Tuniki is proving various extension services to farmers of 380 villages of Medak district and promoting Organic farming among the farmers in approximately 55 villages by way of providing trainings in usage of biological agri inputs. One of the unique approaches of EGVF is that, the farmers are made partners in conception, planning and execution of activities for sustainability. The “Biocontrol Lab“promotes usage of bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides among the famers in Tuniki area of Medak district; Telangana.

                    Indiscriminate and unscientific use of pesticides has led to many problems, such as pests developing resistance, resurgence of once minor pest into a major problem besides environmental and food safety hazards.

                    Pesticides or chemicals are meant to control harmful pests such as insects, nematodes, diseases, weeds etc. However, excessive use of pesticides not only leave residues in soil, water and air but also have adverse effects on the non-target organisms such as pollinators, parasitoids, predators and wild animals.

                    This has adversely affected the ecological balance resulting in pest resurgence, development of resistance in the pest species and environmental pollution. Development of pest resurgence and resistance has resulted in high cost of production and low income especially to cotton farmers in AP, Maharashtra.

                    In view of the several disadvantages associated with the unscientific and improper use of pesticides in agriculture, there is an urgent need for minimizing the use of chemical pesticides in the management of insect pests. Growing public concern over potential health hazards of synthetic pesticides and also steep increase in cost of cultivation/low profit making by farmers has led to the exploration of eco-friendly pest management tactics such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM). IPM aims at suppressing the pest species by combining more than one method of pest control in a harmonious way with least emphasis on the use of insecticides. In simple terms "IPM is the right combination of cultural, biological and chemical measures which provides the most effective, environmentally sound and socially acceptable methods of managing diseases, pests and weeds". The major components of IPM are prevention, observation and intervention. The IPM seems to be the only answer to counter some of the major pests of crops, which have become unmanageable in recent years. The success of IPM largely depends upon conservation of naturally occurring bio control agents.
