                    In order to ensure direct “policy-driven” benefits for Scheduled Castes (SCs) through
                    specific interventions a series of awareness and training programmes were organized by
                    Ekalavya Krishi Vigyan Kendra Tuniki, Medak dist in collaboration with <a href="https://www.icar-iirr.org" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Rice
                    Research (IIRR), Rajendranagar, and Hyderabad</a>. As the changing farm structure with
                    dominance of small landholders is one of the notable features that has been evolving with time
                    and will continue in the upcoming days. Small land holders Scheduled Castes (SCs) farmers are
                    considered as one of the poor suffering group, who are placed at the bottom of the social ladder
                    in India. With SC families having the lowest land ownership in India, these constraints often
                    make them more dependent on wage labour. Entrenched social discrimination and existing
                    socioeconomic realities add to the disadvantages faced by SCs in both farm based and non-farm
                    based labour works. Hence, to improve the livelihood of these smallholders on a sustainable
                    basis and enabling them to participate in the development process in an equitable manner, the
                    Indian Institute of Rice Research has implemented Schedules Caste Sub-Plan (SCSP) through
                    Ekalavya Krishi Vigyan Kendra Tuniki, Medak Dist, to ensure doubling of farmers income in the
                    form of financial and physical benefits to Scheduled Castes of Medak dist.
                </p>
                <p>Under the Scheduled Castes Sub-Plan (SCSP), the focus was on technology
                    dissemination, capacity building of beneficiaries, input support and technology showcasing
                    through exposure visits for the socio-economic empowerment of farmers of Medak Dist in
                    agriculture. Various interfaces and skill up gradation programmes related to agriculture and
                    allied sectors were carried out to solve the problems faced by the farms and also to equip them
                    with the latest ongoing technologies. During the interfaces, the farmers were sensitized on
                    various issues they confront in their day to day work due to their involvement in agricultural and
                    allied activities, especially in the field of vegetable cultivation. Some of their queries and
                    problems were taken up during the interfaces organized and were met through technological
                    interventions. With the vision of doubling the income of farm families, the farmers from SC
                    families were sensitized on some of the horticultural interventions like round the year vegetable
                    cultivation, scientific management of vegetable crops and off-season vegetable production. As
                    part of the SCSP programmes, inputs like seeds of improved varieties, tarpaulins, sprayers and
                    farm implements were also distributed to the SC farmers selected from the adopted villages
                    under KVK programme. Hence, a total of 868 farmers of Medak district were benefited through
                    SC-SP program for the year 2021-22.
