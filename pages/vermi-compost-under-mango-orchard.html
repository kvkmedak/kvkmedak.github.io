                            Vermicompost has been emerging as an important source in supplementing and substituting
                            chemical
                            fertilizers in Agriculture. A number of individuals and institutions are taking interest in
                            the
                            production of vermicompost utilizing earthworm activity. The operational cost of production
                            of
                            vermicompost in a year works out to be 4.2 per kg on average, thus it is quite profitable to
                            sell
                            the compost at Rs. 10/kg. As vermicompost can be produced in any non-economic place with
                            shade, high
                            humidity, and cool temperature, it has a nil operational cost and provides a great scope for
                            earning
                            extra income for the farm. Abandoned cattle shed or poultry shed or unused buildings can be
                            used. It
                            can also be produced in an open area, by providing low-cost thatched roof to protect the
                            unit from
                            direct sunlight.

                        Krishi Vigyan Kendra Tuniki identified a new intervention on the production of vermicompost
                        under mango orchard using galvanized welded mesh ring with the dimensions of 1.6 m diameter, 2
                        ft height, 5 m circumference, size of the mesh hole is 1inch with a capacity of 1-ton FYM/ring.

                            KVK Tuniki established this unit in KVK farm as there is no guarantee to get the income from the
                            mango orchard every year, due to alternate bearing, climatic conditions and fruit dropping due to
                            heavy winds, etc. Therefore the production of vermicompost can give additional/ subsidiary income to
                            the farmers and the land can be utilized effectively and also no need to apply extra nutrition to
                            mango trees as the excess water is drained into the root zone in the form of vermi wash.

                    compost recovery is worked out and presented in the following table.

                            demonstration unit for the farming community. Vermicompost unit comprises 10 pits/beds with well
                            roofed having a size of 15 ft in length, 3 ft in breadth, and 1.5 ft in height. The unit produces
                            about 32 tonnes of vermicompost per annum. The earthworm species i.e Eisenia fetida is being used
                            for vermicompost preparation. KVK gives training and advisory services to the farming community on
