                Water is a major constraint for growing crops in KVK institutional farm it has been difficult to
                maintain plantations, fodder crop vegetables and raising Nursery through traditional flood irrigation.
                Therefore total institutional farm in 30 acres was brought under Micro irrigation through drip
                irrigation, Micro sprinklers, rain guns and new technology of Rain drip irrigation system. This has
                tremendously helped to maintain the KVK farm with least amount of water, saving in labour and timely
                irrigation to the crops. These systems are useful for demonstration cum training unit for visiting
                farmers for adaptation on their farm for quality production of vegetables.
